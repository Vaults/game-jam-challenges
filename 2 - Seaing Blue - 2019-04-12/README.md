### Evaluation

Game turned out fine.


* I need a better mic
* Sound cutting is important to not resolve it in code
* It's good to think about your parameters before you start and ensure you can
tweak them from the get-go
* Difficulty curve is hard (again)
* Simple games can be stressful and fun

Further feedback:

-if you click once it does an action instead of having to click and drag
-sprites could have 3 stages, like the walls could go from intact, cracked and then broken, and trees from sapling, small tree and then full tree
-a counter of your wood resource
-increased difficulty as more of the screen gets taken over by the player


## Running
