### Evaluation

Game turned out fine.


* I need a better mic
* Sound cutting is important to not resolve it in code
* It's good to think about your parameters before you start and ensure you can
tweak them from the get-go
* Difficulty curve is hard (again)
* Simple games can be stressful and fun


## Running

Copy the contents of the distribution folder to a webserver. That's it! JS only.
