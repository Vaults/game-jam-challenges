### Evaluation

The game turned out simple, but nice. Things learned:

* When discussing hard social things, a lot of time is necessary to create a good learning curve
* A lot of time needs to be invested in state management for these kinds of games
* Angular works well for simple click-based static-esque games.
* It's totally possible to make something that is playable within a very short timespan
* Learning a framework and having standard tools helps a lot to go faster

## Running

Copy the contents of the distribution folder to a webserver. Then navigate to the folder and angular should do the rest of the magic :)
