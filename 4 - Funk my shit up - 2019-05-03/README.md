### Evaluation

* This process can be ardously boring.
* I may need to look for something else to do, or bigger projects to tackle.
* Music games are completely **non-trivial**.
* Funk is a difficult topic in music but also in games :P
* Sometimes, you just don't get a good game within your limitations.
