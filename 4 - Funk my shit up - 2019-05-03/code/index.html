            The idea of the game was to have a meter that would increment if you were <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4KNXi-SWWc">blastbeating</a> and some level design
            around that. To accomplish a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhSoJ-lJs4">funny effect</a>.
            Unfortunately I got bored of it. However,
            I still drummed some sounds for you and you can test out the effects of doing this stuff. You want to alternate
            the keys as fast as possible. Enjoy.
