# Ludum dare challenges

This repository contains [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com)-esque challenges. 

The subprojects will consist of either:

* Actual (older) Ludum Dare challenges and their results
* Ludum Dare topic with my own rules
* A topic I pull from http://www.cowfacegames.com/handytools/ludum-dare-theme-generator with my own rules

## My own rules

### Global
* On any day at any time, I may commit to creating an interactive game about a topic.
* The topic may not be known to me before the start and I must take the first topic I see.
* Once I commit there will be a deadline. On default, this will be until midnight of the day of commitment.

### Code
* All assets (art, music, sketches, prototypes) and project code must be committed.
* All assets must be self-made or reused from other personal projects. Libraries are okay.
* After the deadline, only major bugfixes are allowed. 

### Publishing

* The game, or lack thereof must be published in this archive as a reference. 
* There must be clear running instructions for the game.
* After the deadline, deployment issues may be fixed. 
* If a game is a particularly good idea, this will be continued in a new repository.

## Why am I doing this?

There is a large drive to create video games. However, huge ambition and perfectionism gets in the way
of practicing and getting creative. This is meant as a way of doing reps and thinking up cool stuff. Some good
may follow.
